# Movie-Recommender-System-
This project builds a movie recommendation system using the Full MovieLens dataset. After cleaning and exploring the data, an SVD model is used to predict user ratings. The model's performance is evaluated with cross-validation, and personalized movie recommendations are generated based on predicted ratings.
